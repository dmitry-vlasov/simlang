Simple language
================================

This is the implementation of a simple language, which features:

 * AST
 * bytecode
 * executor
 * smm      : the verifier and translator from smm to russell (simplified Metamath)

All programming is done in the language  [Flow](https://github.com/area9innovation/flow9)

Usage
-----
To use Russell just add 'bin' directory to PATH. You also need java runtime environment (JRE).
To compile Russell you'll need JDK 11 or higher.

Prerequisites: java runtime to run, java compiler (11 or higher) to compile, installation of flow9 to modify code.

Dependencies
------------
java runtime (jre) to run, java compiler (11 or higher) to compile, installation of flow9 to modify/examine code.
